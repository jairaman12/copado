    <subject>IMPORTANT PLEASE READ: SENDING PHI/SPI VIA EMAILS IN SALESFORCE</subject>
    <textOnly>It has come to our attention that emails sent externally from Salesforce using the “Send Email” or “Reply” button are not being encrypted when sent.



Staring immediately, all outbound emails containing PHI or SPI must be encrypted by including “Secure” in the subject line (see example below).

This finding is being reported to the Regulatory &amp; Compliance office.



In the meantime, we are in the process of pulling a report to identify all previous emails containing PHI/SPI that were sent externally without the proper encryption.







If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.
